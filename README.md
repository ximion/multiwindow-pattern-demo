# Multiwindow Pattern Demo

Small application to demonstrate some multiwindow SDI UX patterns all at once.
It highlights some X11 deficiencies (including ugly workarounds) and serves as a playground
to check if an implementation of `ext-positioning` in Wayland works correctly (provided Qt implements
the necessary protocol).
